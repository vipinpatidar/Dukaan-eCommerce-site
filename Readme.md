```Dockerfile

    ARG NODE_VERSION=20.11.0

   # Use the official Node.js 20-alpine as a base image
   FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine

   # Create app directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json to take advantage of caching
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Build the Vite app for production
   # RUN npm run build

   # Expose the port that Vite will use
   EXPOSE 5173

   # Start the Vite development server
   CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

      # specify the ports to expose for the db service
      # generally, we do this in api service using mongodb atlas. But for demo purposes, we're using a local mongodb instance

#### Creating Images and container from .yaml file

1.  Running in watch mode

    docker-compose watch

2.  Without watch mode

    docker-compose up

3.  Stop and Remove containers

    docker-compose down

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed globally.
- MongoDB instance.
- Stripe account for payment integration.

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-repo

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

- MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_url
- SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
- STRIPE_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
- PORT=your_preferred_port_number

5. Start the backend server:npm start

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd dukaan/frontend

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following variable:
   VITE_STRIPE_KEY=stripe secret key
   VITE_SERVER_URL=backend server URL
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID

4. Start the frontend development server:npm run dev

## Usage

- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:your_frontend_port.

- Replace your_frontend_port with the port number specified in the frontend setup.

- Explore the Dukaan app, browse products, and make purchases.

- To become an admin, register an account and update your user role in the database to 'admin'.
